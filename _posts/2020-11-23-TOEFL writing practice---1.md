**University students should be required to take history courses no matter what field they study.**

# Essay



University education is of paramount importance to future development of all the students, and there are a variety of courses for students to select. Some people recently suggested that universities should make history courses compulsory for all of the college students in order to let them know the evolution and development of the world we live in. In my viewpoint, I disagree with their opinion for the following three reasons.

To begin with, extra history courses will put more pressure on students, especially for those who do not major in history. The courses and assignments related to their majors have been already burdensome, so it is truly hard for students to spare some time for history courses. Like a chemistry student, they are required not only to finish their courses for credits, but also do a lots of experiments on lab, which can be very stressful. If they have to take a extra history course apart from this, they should probably worry about their final examinations.

In addition, setting up courses for everyone in the college can be quite expensive. The college needs to hire some domain-specific professors and experts and purchase textbooks and material for the sake for high quality of this course, which can lead to serious financial problems. In that case, the college may invest less or even cut the cost of other equipment and facilities. On the other hand, the students need to pay an extra tuition fee for this course as well.

It is undeniable that knowing about history is beneficial for all the individuals. Student can gain a better understanding of the current events by learning history. For example, by learning the world wars, students can be aware of the significance of the peace in today's world. However, taking history courses is certainly not the best way to obtain history knowledge. By looking up on the Internet, we are able to learn whatever we want. Besides we can read books in the library or even attend lectures hold in the university. These are all more convenient and efficient ways to learn about history.

In conclusion,  although there are some merits of taking history courses, we justify that arranging history courses can be time-consuming for students and also expensive for colleges, not to mention that we have better choices of acquiring history knowledge. (388 words)
