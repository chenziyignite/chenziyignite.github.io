                <li>letting children make decisions</li>
                <p>
                    strong willed/opinionated children/encourage children to make decisions for themselves.<br>
                    children are lack of knowledge and experience, children have undeveloped moral values(instill values in children), children are innocent -> children can be tricked or lured, children are not likely to make thoughtful decisions, tend to/be inclined to/be prone to/show a tendency/ make mistakes, children cannot differentiate/distinguish right from wrong and may go down the wrong path of life.->harmful/detrimental/dangerous/destructive consequences<br>
                    control over children's choices, guide the children

                <p>
                    example: Children often show signs of picky eating, some of them really enjoy unhealthy food like junk food. Apparently we can't let them eat their favorable food every meal, because it will finally lead to lack of nutrition or obesity... So it is parents'obligation to guide their child to do the right thing. 
                </p>
                <li>lack of parental involvement in education</li>
                <p>
                    parent are the prime educators untils children go to nursery or school, they help children promote physical, emotional and intellectual development. So parent play a crucial role in education. It will be more beneficial if school and parents work in partnership. cognitive development and literacy and number skill.<br>
                    without parental involvement, bad engagement and achievement<br>

                <li>rewarding money</li>
                <p>
                    children manage their money -> make decisions<br>
                    failed to make a financial plan/budgeting<br>
                    lured -> develop bad habit -> alcohol, cigaratte,drug...<br>
                    lured -> money deception<br>
                    misguide, what is the purpose of studying? -> whenever the money is cut, children will lose the motivation.
                </p>
                <li>parents more involved in children's education than in the past</li>
                <p>
                    parents are highly educated, have literacy ability, capable of involving education.<br>
                    parents tend to raise one kid instead of many kids,attention on one kid.<br>
                    the growing awareness of how important education is, good education correspond to good future prospects.
